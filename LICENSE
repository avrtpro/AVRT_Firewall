FOUNDER'S NOTE:

AVRT™ was built from the front seat of a car during 2.5 years of homelessness
and recovery. It represents not just code, but a protection protocol born from
lived hardship and built for global AI safety.

This is the ethical firewall the AI industry needs.

Be Good. Be Humble. Be Protected.™
