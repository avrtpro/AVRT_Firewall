# AVRT™ — Advanced Voice Reasoning Technology

**Voice-First Ethical Middleware Firewall for AI Governance, Auditability, and Compliance**

---

## Overview

AVRT™ (Advanced Voice Reasoning Technology) is a **voice-first ethical middleware firewall** designed to enhance governance, auditability, and trust in AI systems.

AVRT does **not** replace or compete with large language models.  
It operates as a **middleware governance layer** that evaluates, enforces, and records policy decisions around AI interactions—particularly in regulated environments such as healthcare, finance, and government.

The core value of AVRT is **accountability**: the ability to demonstrate, with cryptographically verifiable proof, **what an AI system did, why it did it, and which policies were applied**.

---

## What AVRT Does

- Interposes a middleware layer between users and AI models to **analyze and validate interactions**
- Uses the **SPIEL™ framework** (Safety, Personalization, Integrity, Ethics, Logic) to score AI outputs
- Implements the **THT™ protocol** (Truth, Honesty, Transparency) to validate reasoning and intent
- Applies configurable **policy enforcement** to allow, block, or escalate AI responses
- Generates **audit-ready, blockchain-ready logs** using SHA-256 hashing for integrity verification
- Supports enterprise governance, compliance reviews, and regulatory audits

AVRT is designed to support **post-decision governance and auditability** without introducing unacceptable latency into real-time voice interactions.

---

## What AVRT Is Not

- AVRT is **not** a real-time audio interception engine
- AVRT does **not** process raw audio streams
- AVRT does **not** replace LLMs or generate AI responses
- AVRT does **not** guarantee perfect AI safety or eliminate hallucinations
- AVRT is **not** a traditional cybersecurity firewall

AVRT provides **proof and accountability**, not omniscience.

## Enterprise Use Cases

- Governance and auditability for voice-based AI systems
- Compliance support for HIPAA, SOX, FedRAMP, and similar frameworks
- Risk reduction for enterprise AI deployments
- Policy validation and enforcement in regulated workflows
- Cryptographically verifiable AI decision records

---

## Architecture (High-Level)

1. User interacts with AI system (voice or text)
2. AI platform processes input and generates structured intent and response
3. AVRT evaluates policy using SPIEL™ and THT™
4. AVRT enforces configured policies
5. AVRT records immutable audit logs with SHA-256 integrity proofs
6. Logs may be exported for compliance, legal, or regulatory review

## Intellectual Property

AVRT™ is protected by a filed U.S. utility patent covering:
- Voice-first middleware firewall architecture
- SPIEL™ scoring framework
- THT™ protocol validation
- Policy enforcement mechanisms
- Audit trail and cryptographic proof systems

Public descriptions are aligned with the scope of the filed claims.
